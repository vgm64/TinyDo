# TinyDo
A native android widget for Todoist with extra small text to max out information density.

This serves as an example app for learning how to make an Android widget while also solving
a real use case, which is that the current Todoist widget will show four todo items when
spread over half of the screen of a Galaxy S7. Four. There's more white space than McMurdo 
Station's backyard.

Make sure you replace the placeholder API key in ``TodoistAPIKeyHolder``.
